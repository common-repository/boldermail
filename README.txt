= How are We Different? =

Our first difference lies in the fact that we were our own first client. My wife, Lindsey, started [The Postman's Knock](https://thepostmansknock.com) in 2013, and it has since grown to be the #1 online resource for learning calligraphy. Fast forward a few years to 2018, and we were stuck paying Mailchimp around $500 a month ($6,000 a year) to mail our list of 100,000 subscribers 3x per week. I projected our costs would rise to $8,500 by 2019, and $10,000 by 2020. In response to the rising costs, we developed Boldermail to meet our email marketing and automation needs, without sacrificing quality nor reliability. And we loved it so much that we knew we had to make it available to others. You can read more of our story [here](https://www.boldermail.com/our-story).

Our second difference is that we do not use your WordPress server to deliver emails. Unlike other WordPress plugins, and similar to Mailchimp and MailerLite, a separate server does all of the heavy lifting for you! This ensures that your website does not get sluggish as it struggles to send emails to subscribers.

== Installation ==

1. Visit the Plugins page within your WordPress dashboard and select "Add New".
2. Search for "Boldermail".
3. Activate Boldermail from your Plugins page.
4. Follow the instructions in the Getting Started guide [here](https://www.boldermail.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-boldermail/).

Note that this plugin is meant to communicate with our servers at Boldermail. You will need to create an account [here](https://www.boldermail.com/pricing/) to properly use the plugin.

== Screenshots ==

8. Track which and how many subscribers opened your newsletter, and clicked on specific links.
9. The newsletter editor will be familiar to you because it uses the native WordPress editor to customize your emails!
10. Just like at Mailchimp, videos are converted to email-friendly images when you use the [youtube] or [vimeo] shortcodes.
11. Multiple HTML templates are included for free!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a free trial? =

Yes! The first 30 days (up to 100,000 emails sent in that period) are on us. Select a plan, and the discount will be applied at checkout. No credit card required! After you complete the checkout process, we’ll contact you within 24 hours with login credentials to enter in your plugin settings.

= How do I get started? =

Follow the instructions on our [Getting Started](https://www.boldermail.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-boldermail/) guide. After your free trial ends, you will need to configure an account on Amazon Web Services. This extra step is the secret sauce that allows us to offer such incredible rates to you! Nevertheless, it only takes our customers an average of 10 minutes to be up and running with Boldermail.

= What do I get when I sign up for Boldermail? =

You get access to our email marketing and automation platform all from within your WordPress dashboard. The plugin offers an intuitive and user-friendly way to manage your subscribers and design your email campaigns. Our mailing servers do all of the heavy lifting for you to ensure that your website does not get sluggish as you send emails to your subscribers.

= I completed the steps in the Getting Started guide. What now? =

Just wait! We’ll get back to you within 24 hours with your login credentials. You will enter these credentials in your plugin settings in WordPress to connect the plugin to our servers.

= Can you guarantee that my emails will be delivered and won’t be marked as spam? =

Yes! Our mailing servers use [Amazon Simple Email Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), which is incredibly reliable. When we setup your Boldermail account, we will verify your email address and/or web address to make sure email hosting providers do not flag your emails as spam.


= My newsletter list is important to me. Why should I trust my business to you? =

Boldermail is more than just a service to us — it’s an integral part of our business. My wife, Lindsey, runs The Postman’s Knock, the #1 resource for learning calligraphy online. We have a list of 100,000 subscribers, and we send over 15 million emails per year. We developed Boldermail to save on costs without compromising on quality, and we have been using it as our own email marketing platform since 2018. (You can read more about our story [here](https://www.boldermail.com/our-story/).) I can guarantee you that we strive to make Boldermail the best it can be because we depend on it 100%!


= How does your service compare to other free WordPress plugins? =

Unlike most WordPress plugins, we do not use your WordPress website to send the newsletters. Using your WordPress site to send emails in bulk is a bad idea, and may lead to your visitors having slow loading times or seeing errors on your frontend. We utilize separate powerful servers to deliver your emails.

= How does your plugin compare with other premium WordPress plugins? =

Some premium plugins use your WordPress site to send emails. Others charge you hefty fees to deliver the emails for you. We are cheaper than the competition because our servers use Amazon Simple Email Services, and that translates into hundreds or thousands of dollars of savings to you! Calculate your savings [here](https://www.boldermail.com/#pricing).

= How does your service compare to other services, like Mailchimp or MailerLite? =

Mailchimp and MailerLite are great services. We speak from experience, as we have used them both in the past (you can read about our journey [here](https://www.boldermail.com/a-journey-from-feedburner-to-aweber-to-mailchimp-to-our-own-platform-boldermail/).) However, as your subscriber list increases, their costs increase dramatically. You can [save thousands of dollars](https://www.boldermail.com/#pricing) a year using our services! The first difference you will see is in the interface — Mailchimp has a sleek albeit separate interface, while Boldermail utilizes a WordPress-native approach. The second difference is that we do not provide all of Mailchimp’s extra features, like landing pages, Facebook and Instagram ads, postcards, etc. We focus exclusively on the email marketing campaigns.

= Does Boldermail work with RSS feeds? =

Yes! The first email automation feature we developed for Boldermail was the ability to automatically send new blog post notifications to our subscribers. Not only can you setup Boldermail to deliver your freshly-created blog content to your subscribers, but you can also customize your template any way you want. The plugin will even convert embedded videos into email-friendly images for you!
